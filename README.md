Self-Driving Car with YOLOv8
Overview
This project implements a self-driving car system using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. The system detects vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and other relevant objects in real-time, enabling the car to make safe driving decisions.

Features
Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
Supports detection of multiple classes (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, etc.)
Video and live camera stream processing
Simple user interface for displaying detection results

Requirements
Python 3.8+
OpenCV
PyTorch
Ultralytics YOLOv8
NumPy
